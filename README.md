# Toronto Traffic Accident Prediction Models

This repository contains .ipynb files for a deep learning model to predict the location and liklihood of traffic accidents in the Toronto downtown core.

Contained in this repository are the following files:
- Primary model: contains code for data preprocessing and cleaning (to create graph of Toronto downtown core road networks) and implementation of a GCN-ANN model to predict accident locations and liklihoods
  - Note: the downtown core graph model and training file is an older iteration of the primary model
- Baseline model: contains a 3-layer ANN that predicts the liklihood of a neighbour node having a collision

This repository was created for the APS360 course (Summer 2025) at the University of Toronto. The key contributors to this project are Jaden Bhogal, Nicholas Sinclair, William Tessier, and Noah Selda.
